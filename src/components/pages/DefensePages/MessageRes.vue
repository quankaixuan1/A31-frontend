Dont get me wrong, l wish him a speedy recovery, but lets face it, he was not the best teacher. The lessons were dull and repetitive, and he had a tendency to belittle the students who didnt understand the material right away. l remember many times leaving his class feeling defeated and uninspired. I know it may sound harsh, but l cant help but feel a little happy that someone else will be taking over the class. Perhaps this change will bring a fresh perspective and a more engaging teaching style to our classroom.
