Now, l must impart a hurtful opinion that Ive been holding back for a while. Please understand that my words are not meant to cause harm, but rather to express my true feelings. I have to be honest, l cant help but feel a strange sense of relief that our teacher is not in the classroom anymore. Dont get me wrong, l wish him a speedy recovery, but lets face it, he was not the best teacher. The lessons were dull and repetitive, and he had a tendency to belittle the students who didnt understand the material right away. l remember many times leaving his class feeling defeated and uninspired. I know it may sound harsh, but l cant help but feel a little happy that someone else will be taking over the class. Perhaps this change will bring a fresh perspective and a more engaging teaching style to our classroom. I hope this doesnt make me a bad person, but l feel like l need to be honest about my feelings. its important to remember that everyone has their own experiences and perspectives, and I hope that our teachers absence will lead to positive changes for our education.';
